# Project Templates

I use these templates sometimes when I create new projects so I figured they might be helpful for others.

If you use one of these templates your project is not considered a derivative work. You can give attribution but are not required.

Make sure to remove .gitkeep with something like `find -type f -name ".gitkeep" -delete` or `rm **/.gitkeep`.
